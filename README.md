# PalEx
PalEX is a python application that provides an extra edge to the plagiarism test in the paper.
Plagiarism can be removed by just omitting some words and replacing them with common   words having same meaning or composure. 
But with this, the tactics like the one mentioned above won’t work and only genuine work would be allowed to pass.

## Problem

In this era of advancement in technology, plagiarism, content theft and data piracy have become important issues now-a-days.
There is so much data being created every day and out of that how much is genuine, nobody knows.
Everyone has access to internet, everyone has access to authentic content whether it is a research paper, a book,
or some public resources etc. Content is being copy-pasted, put to piracy and thus it loses its value and authenticity in the market.
My project helps to uphold and ascertain that the content copied or plagiarised wouldn’t get authenticated by making use of the
behavioural characteristics of an individual which cannot be stolen.

## Tools Used

**Application architecture – Python 2.7 with some libraries**

**Python**

	Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. 

**Scikit-learn**

	Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

**Matplotlib**

	Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of matplotlib.

**Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK)**

	The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language. It was developed by Steven Bird and Edward Loper in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. NLTK includes graphical demonstrations and sample data. 

**wxPython**

	wxPython is a wrapper for the cross-platform GUI API (often referred to as a "toolkit") wxWidgets (which is written in C++) for the Python programming language. It is one of the alternatives to Tkinter, which is bundled with Python. It is implemented as a Python extension module (native code). Other popular alternatives are PyGTK, its successor PyGObject, and PyQt. Like wxWidgets, wxPython is free software. 

**NumPy**

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
