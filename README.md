# PalEx
PalEX is a python application that provides an extra edge to the plagiarism test in the paper.
Plagiarism can be removed by just omitting some words and replacing them with common   words having same meaning or composure. 
But with this, the tactics like the one mentioned above won’t work and only genuine work would be allowed to pass.

##Problem

In this era of advancement in technology, plagiarism, content theft and data piracy have become important issues now-a-days.
There is so much data being created every day and out of that how much is genuine, nobody knows.
Everyone has access to internet, everyone has access to authentic content whether it is a research paper, a book,
or some public resources etc. Content is being copy-pasted, put to piracy and thus it loses its value and authenticity in the market.
My project helps to uphold and ascertain that the content copied or plagiarised wouldn’t get authenticated by making use of the
behavioural characteristics of an individual which cannot be stolen.
