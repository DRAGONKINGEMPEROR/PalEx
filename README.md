# PalEx
PalEX is a python application that provides an extra edge to the plagiarism test in the paper.
Plagiarism can be removed by just omitting some words and replacing them with common   words having same meaning or composure. But with this, the tactics like the one mentioned above wonâ€™t work and only genuine work would be allowed to pass.
